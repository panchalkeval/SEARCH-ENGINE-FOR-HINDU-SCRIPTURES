            The Bhagavad Gita, often abbreviated as the Gita, is a revered Hindu scripture that forms a crucial part of the Mahabharata, specifically chapters 23–40 of book 6 known as the Bhishma Parva. This ancient text, composed in Sanskrit, comprises 700 verses structured into poetic meters, primarily the shloka. Preserved in Mahabharata manuscripts, the Gita exists in various Indic scripts, with minor variations among manuscripts.

            Comprising 18 chapters, the Bhagavad Gita addresses a spectrum of life's facets, including duty, spirituality, and ethical dilemmas. Each shloka is a couplet, resulting in a complete text of 1,400 lines, with two quarter verses in each shloka, precisely eight syllables per quarter verse. The metered verse form, although lacking rhyme, serves as the principal meter in the Gita. This intricate structure and poetic form contribute to the aesthetic and philosophical richness of the Bhagavad Gita, enhancing its timeless significance as a spiritual and literary masterpiece.

            In Hindu mythology, the Bhagavad Gita is believed to be written by the sage Veda Vyasa, with Ganesha as the scribe. It serves as a synthesis of Hindu ideas, addressing concepts of dharma, theistic bhakti, and the yogic pursuit of moksha. The Gita covers different yogas, including Jñāna, Bhakti, Karma, and Rāja yogas, drawing inspiration from the Samkhya-Yoga philosophy.

            Set on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, the Gita delves into Arjuna's inner conflict about participating in the war against his own kin. Krishna's guidance extends beyond the immediate war scenario, encompassing profound philosophical and ethical teachings that transcend the battlefield.
            <br><br>
            
            At the heart of the Gita's teachings is the concept of the individual self (Atman) and the supreme self (Brahman) within each being. The dialogue explores various perspectives on the relationship between Atman and Brahman, ranging from non-dualism to qualified non-dualism and complete duality.
            <br><br>
            
            The Gita holds immense significance in Hinduism and has garnered diverse interpretations. The title "Bhagavad Gita" translates to the "song of God" or the "Divine Song." In India, it is often referred to with great respect as Shrimad Bhagavad Gita.
            <br><br>
            
            The Gita also incorporates elements of Sanskrit prosody, one of the six Vedangas or limbs of Vedic studies. At certain dramatic moments, it employs the tristubh meter found in the Vedas, where each line of the couplet contains two quarter verses with exactly eleven syllables.
            <br><br>
            
            It's noteworthy that the original Bhagavad Gita does not have chapter titles. However, some Sanskrit editions, as well as translators, have added chapter titles. For instance, Swami Chidbhavananda categorizes each of the eighteen chapters as a separate yoga, likening them to disciplines that "train the body and the mind." He names the first chapter as "Arjuna Vishada Yogam" or the "Yoga of Arjuna's Dejection." Similarly, Sir Edwin Arnold titled this chapter in his 1885 translation as "The Distress of Arjuna."
